# dompile Starter Kit

Welcome to the **dompile Starter Kit**, a minimal scaffolding to get started building static sites with [dompile](https://github.com/dompile/cli).

dompile is a zero-boilerplate, convention-based static site generator that uses only standard HTML and a single `<include />` element to provide layouts, component includes, and scoped styles/scripts - all at build time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dompile/starter-kit my-site
cd my-site
```

### 2. Preview your site

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Add Your Content

Now you can begin editing the files in the `src/` to see your changes updated in the browser in realtime.

The built site will appear in the `dist/` folder.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
my-site/
├── components/
│   └── card.html
├── layouts/
│   └── default.html
└── index.html
├── dist/
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

Happy hacking with ✨ **dompile** ✨
